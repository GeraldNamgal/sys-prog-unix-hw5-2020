    For non-built-in commands:
    
    In order to redirect stdout, we must change the default file descriptor in
    the child process to point to a file that it can write to. Thus, after a
    fork(), the child process would need to use an appropriate method that was
    discussed in class such as using dup2() that would close the current
    connection on file descriptor 1 (the index that stdout is used for) and then
    change an open fd that was created by a call to a function that opens files
    such as creat() to using the fd 1 position (by rule of "lowest available fd"
    which would then be fd 1) for its file output. Under this new data flow
    configuration, the child process could then call execvp() passing in the
    command to be redirected and the output of the command would appear in the
    specified file, i.e., instead of on the terminal screen. In "smallsh", this
    could all be done in execute() in the "process.c" file in the child process'
    code. To paraphrase from lecture 9's "stdinredir2.c" code, this could
    include the following code:

    int	fd, newfd;
    fd = creat(filename, mode);	     /* open the disk file	*/
    newfd = dup2(fd,1);		         /* close 1, dup fd to 1 */
    if ( newfd != 1 ){
		fprintf(stderr,"Could not duplicate fd to 1\n");
		perror("dup2");
		exit(1);
	}
	close(fd);			             /* close original fd	*/
    execvp(commandv[0], commandv);

    For built-in commands:

    To redirect built-in commands, the process is similar to non-built-in
    commands except a fork() isn't involved and instead of calling execvp()
    after moving the file descriptor, it does its own function(s).
